Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. Everyone feels lonely at times. Maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone.\"},\n",

When we are stressed, we usually know what we're stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. Anxiety, on the other hand, isn't always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself.

Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn\\'t pass the test. \\n It\\'s so easy to spread information online, and we can\\'t assume that the source we\\'re reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything, you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it\\'s a reliable source. \\n Reliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness include the World Health Organization (WHO), Government of Canada ministries and agencies like Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Government of BC ministries and agencies like the BC Ministry of Health, and the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information. \\n Headlines and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more. \\n Websites that belong to governments, government-funded agencies, well-known health providers, universities, or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don\\'t list the author or don\\'t tell you much about themselves. Double-check the author and the credentials of any \\'experts\\' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed. \\n Can you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Does the author list their sources? Are the sources legitimate, like research journals? \\n Unhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared, angry, distrustful, vulnerable. Phrases like \"Skyrocketing rates of infection\" are sensational and they\\'re meant to make people feel afraid. On the other hand, factual statements like \"We have 50 new cases in BC\" give you important information without playing into your emotions. Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered. \\n Who is paying for the site? What products or services are being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience, or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service? \\n Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, especially as we practice physical distancing or self-isolation. Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community. \\n Like any other source of information, it\\'s important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results. You\\'ll see both very poor-quality sources next to good-quality sources, and it\\'s up to you to decide which is which. In addition, social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information. \\n Visit www.mediasmarts.ca to learn more about digital and media literacy \\n Visit www.healthnewsreview.org to learn more about thinking critically around health claims (this resource is no longer updated daily, but all toolkits and lessons are still available) \\n This page is adapted from the Evaluating Mental Health and Substance Use Information info sheet.'},\n",

The truth is that we don't know what will happen next—but that doesn't mean we're all helpless. You can do a lot. You can: \\n Map out a daily schedule, including times you can connect with loved ones online or by phone \\n Plan out daily tasks and goals \\n Give yourself a schedule to look up current information \\n Make sure you have 14 days of healthy food and household supplies at home \\n Keep medications on hand and talk to your doctor for advice if you're at increased risk \\n Educate yourself on public health measures and figure out how you'll follow those instructions \\n Figure out how you'll manage increased childcare demands, working for home, or other changes to your usual routine \\n Determine if you'll need financial supports like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit or BC Temporary Rent Supplement if your job is affected by COVID-19. If you anticipate a need, you can find application instructions and gather any documents or other pieces of information ahead of time \\n Figure out how you'll manage times when you feel overwhelmed or hopeless, like calming activities, the number for a local support or crisis line, a video chat with a loved one, or a way to connect with your mental health care provider \\n Look for local support organizations, neighbourhood groups, or mutual aid groups if you need extra help or support or would like to help others in your community \\n Some planning will be straightforward, but you may also encounter situations or times when it's harder to see a solution or good plan of action.

We're all in this together. \\n While you may be physically separated from friends, family members, and other loved ones, it has never been more important to maintain those social connections. Social connections are an opportunity to seek and share support, talk through difficult feelings, share a laugh, keep up-to-date with loved ones, and help each other cope. This pandemic is a lot for one person to deal with on their own. While measures like physical distancing and self-isolation are necessary to slow the spread of the virus, the physical separation can amplify a lot of challenging emotions like loneliness and fear. \\n Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. \\n Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. \\n The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. \\n Everyone feels lonely at times—maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. \\n Reach out to the connections you do have.

       "  'Response': \"Taking care of your physical health is also good for your mental health. It's more important than ever to keep yourself healthy. \\n Try to eat as well as you can. It may be easier to reach for unhealthier comfort foods and snacks while you spend more time at home, but try to keep a balanced approach. When you stock up on groceries, don’t ignore fresh fruit and vegetables—we still have everything we need to prepare food. Now that we're advised to limit the amount of time we spend in public spaces like grocery stores, this is a great time to try out new fruits and vegetables that keep at home for longer periods of time. \\n If it's safer for you to stay home or you are in self-isolation, reach out for help. Many grocery stores and meal prep services offer safe, no-contact delivery. You can also ask family or friends to bring you groceries, or look for local COVID-19 support groups on social media. It's safest if others leave food and other supplies outside of your door to avoid spreading the virus. \\n Exercise is an important part of mental health and well-being, stress management, and health sleep. However, it's something that many people give up when they start to feel stressed or overwhelmed. \\n If it's safe for you to do so, spend time outside. You should still avoid busy areas or groups and stay at least two metres away from others, but there is no reason to avoid walks, runs, or other safe outdoor activities. (Note that some municipalities, BC Parks, and Parks Canada have restricted some outdoor spaces to reduce crowds, so check the status of your local parks or trails and respect closures—they're just keeping everyone safe.) \\n If you prefer to exercise indoors, you can also find many different exercises classes online. You can try yoga, follow a barre class, work on your cardio, pick up a new dumbbell routine, and keep up with Crossfit WODs from the comfort of your living room. Look for no-equipment exercise routines or classes if you don't already have equipment. \\n Poor sleep can make even simple problems feel a lot worse than they really are. Poor sleep can affect your mood, your outlook, and your patience. Unfortunately, stress and anxiety can really take a toll on your sleep. If you're having a hard time sleeping, be proactive and practice healthy sleep habits. For more, check out Wellness Module 6: Getting a Good Night's Sleep at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-6-getting-a-good-nights-sleep. \\n If you have other health problems like a chronic illness, check in with your doctor or health care team to see if you need to take any additional measures or precautions. Remember to plan ahead and do what you can to keep prescription or over-the-counter medications, medical supplies, supplements, or other health needs on hand.\"},\n",
       " {'Context': 'How can I use distraction to manage difficult thoughts or feelings?',\n",
       "  'Knowledge': '',\n",
       "  'Response': \"Distraction is a very valid tool to help you cope when everything feels overwhelming or when you feel lonely or isolated. \\n If you don't have a lot of energy or focus right now, try low-effort distractions like watching TV, browsing Youtube, listening to a podcast or audiobook, playing a game on your phone, reading an easy book or magazine, or working on a simple art project. \\n If you have more energy and focus, give yourself a to-do list every day: you can clean and take care of projects around your home, work on hobbies, connect with family or friends, read a new book and catch up on your favourite TV shows. You can find interesting opportunities to take online courses from universities all over the world through MOOCs and other online learning platforms, you can learn a new language online or through apps, and you can learn new hobbies and activities. As more people have to practice social distancing or self-isolation, people are finding creative ways to bring the world into their homes: you can tour museums and art galleries, Skype with a scientist, watch animals at zoos and nature preserves, and more. \\n When normal schedules are disrupted, it's easy to fall into unhelpful habits. Look for ways to keep yourself on track with healthier habits. You could set yourself goals every day or turn activities into a fun competition with friends or family—whoever takes the most language classes wins! \\n Many communities are using social media platforms like Facebook to organize support and help for neighbours. If you are healthy and it's safe to do so, you can sign up to walk dogs, pick up groceries and household supplies, and help others who can't go out at the moment. This can be a great way to make new connections in your area, and helping others is good for your own mental health. Just be sure to follow good hygiene practices and physical distancing—your own health is important.\"},\n",

       "  'Knowledge': '',\n",
       "  'Response': 'How you think about something impacts your feelings and your behaviours. \\n When we feel stressed out, angry, or fearful, it\\'s hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have. (Remember: we all control our own actions and reactions, no matter what\\'s going on in the world. We can call do something about this pandemic.) \\n People often overestimate the negative parts—their own feelings, their own abilities to manage a difficult situation, or the situation itself—and underestimate positive parts—their own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones, their support networks, and opportunities. \\n How does the thought \"We\\'re never going to make it through this!\" make you feel? It likely doesn\\'t feel good—and it isn\\'t even true. \\n Challenging negative, unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood, validate your ability to get through this, and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well. \\n Stop and notice thoughts that come up. How do they make you feel? Do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively? How can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful? Can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation? \\n Here are a few example: \\n \"I\\'m so mad that my event was cancelled! This sucks!\" \\n \"I know this is the safer option for everyone. When it\\'s rescheduled, I\\'ll enjoy it more because I won\\'t have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness.\" \\n \"I hate spending so much time at home. This is so boring.\" \\n \"I\\'m doing my part to keep my neighbours safe. It\\'s worth it because it keeps people healthy.\" \\n \"I\\'m having a hard time getting used to my new schedule. This is so frustrating.\" \\n \"I\\'ll get used to this soon, just like I adapted the last time I had to change my schedule. Now that I\\'m home more, I\\'ll have more time to finish the projects I haven\\'t touched in months and I\\'m excited to see the end results. \\n \"I\\'m really scared and I don\\'t know what to do. I feel so overwhelmed right now.\" \\n \"It makes sense that I feel scared—people are getting sick and we don\\'t know when things will go back to normal. But there are a lot of things I can do to keep healthy, and I\\'m going to do some research so I can do my best. When I focus on the things I can do, everything feels more manageable.\" \\n \"We\\'re going to be stuck inside forever. I\\'m already sick of this.\" \\n \"I understand that it will take some time to manage COVID-19, and I trust that health care professionals and scientists are working as fast as they can. I know this will end eventually and life will go back to normal.\" \\n The goal is not to ignore the bad or uncomfortable parts of the situation or deny that there\\'s a problem. Instead, this exercise can help you understand the situation more realistically and see the parts that you can control right now.'},\n",
       " {'Context': 'How can I challenge thinking traps?',\n",
       "  'Knowledge': '',\n",
       "  'Response': 'What you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do. Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects—this is normal and expected. However, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. You\\'re also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term. \\n These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You\\'re most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. You\\'re also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you\\'re not taking good care of yourself, like when you\\'re not eating or sleeping well. \\n Here are some common thinking traps: \\n Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. People who overgeneralize often use words like \"always\" or \"never.\" \\n I was really looking forward to that concert, and now it’s cancelled. This always happens to me! I never get to do fun things! \\n Seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure. \\n I wanted to eat healthier, but I ate too many snacks today. This plan is a total failure! \\n Saying only negative things about yourself or other people. \\n I made a mistake. I\\'m stupid! My boss told me that I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk! \\n Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence. \\n I\\'ve been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks, but I just know that I\\'m going to get sick. \\n Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive. \\n I know there\\'s a lot I can do at home, but I\\'m just so sick of this. Everything is terrible. \\n Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation. \\n I feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better. \\n Telling yourself how you \"should\" or \"must\" act. \\n I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! \\n Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca. \\n Don\\'t try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way. \\n This doesn\\'t let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. When you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind. \\n Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens: \\n What is the situation? What actually happened? Only include facts that everyone would agree on. \\n What are your thoughts? What are you telling yourself? \\n What are your emotions? How do you feel? \\n What are your behaviours? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope? \\n Take a look at the thoughts you\\'ve listed. Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? It\\'s common to fall into more than one thinking trap. Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation. \\n The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. Use the evidence you\\'ve collected to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do that: \\n Try to find evidence against the thought. If you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, \"I can\\'t do anything right! I must be a terrible employee!\" When this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, \"Is there any evidence to support this thought? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought?\" You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn\\'t support the idea that you\\'re a bad employee. \\n Ask yourself, \"Would I judge other people if they did the same thing? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people?\" This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism. \\n Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, \"Good parents wouldn\\'t have this kind of problem.\" To challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they\\'ve ever had any problems with their kids. \\n Test your beliefs in person. For example, if you think that your friends don\\'t care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. If you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you. \\n Once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. Let\\'s use the following example: \\n I feel sad and overwhelmed. I\\'m having a hard time figuring out what to do. \\n I\\'m the worst! I should be able to handle this! \\n Labeling \\n \\'Should\\' statements \\n Examine the evidence: I have a lot of challenges right now. I\\'m worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I\\'ve successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so I know I can do this. \\n It\\'s okay to feel upset right now—there\\'s a lot going on. I\\'m going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me. I\\'m trying to do a lot on my own, so I\\'m going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together. \\n Try the Healthy Thinking Worksheet at www.heretohelp.bc.ca \\n Check out Anxiety Canada\\'s articles Helpful Thinking and Thinking Traps \\n This page is adapted from Wellness Module 8: Healthy Thinking at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-8-healthy-thinking.'},\n",

       "  'Response': \"While a lot of people think of grief in terms of losing a person or pet, grief can come up whenever you lose something important. This includes: \\n Losing security, like losing your job or wondering how long you'll be able to pay rent \\n Losing stability or routine, like finding yourself working from home or navigating childcare closures \\n Losing your sense of safety, like fearing you or someone you love might end up with COVID-19 \\n Losing your social relationships, like missing time with family and friends now that everyone must practice physical distancing or self-isolation \\n Losing hope for the future, like feeling that life will never go back to normal \\n Losing important goals, like finding your classes, sports competitions, or performances are cancelled for the foreseeable future \\n Losing important milestone celebrations like graduation ceremonies and weddings \\n Grief bring up complicated feelings. You might feel sad, angry, frustrated, fearful, or hopeless. You may have a hard time eating or sleeping, or feel very tense. You may feel overwhelmed and tired. You may wonder if life will ever feel normal again. \\n Everyone grieves in their own way and their own time. Here are some strategies to try as you navigate your own journey. \\n Acknowledge and express your feelings in a healthy way. Give your feelings a name and find healthy ways to express them, such as by talking with a friend, writing in a journal, or making art. \\n Give yourself as much time as you need. Grief follows its own schedule. Give yourself permission to use this time to take care of your well-being. Let go of expectations, tasks, or other obligations that can wait. \\n Seek support. Grief can feel very isolating, even though a lot of people are experiencing some sort of loss right now. Reach out to friends or family and share your feelings. Look for ways to help and support each other. \\n Take care of yourself. Ignoring health and well-being can make difficult experiences feel worse. Eat as well as you can, try to get enough sleep, spend time outside if it's safe for you to do so, and exercise regularly. Think about self-care activities or strategies that have helped you cope with challenging situations in the past and make time for those activities. \\n Know that feelings of grief will pass. Grief may feel intense at times, but those feelings will become more manageable over time and will eventually pass. \\n Connect with a mental health professional if you're having a hard time.

Some use psychotherapy (‘talk therapies’) approaches like cognitive-behavioural therapy to treat mental health problems. Many psychiatrists work at hospitals, clinics, or health centres, and some have a private office. As they are specialist doctors, you will almost always need another doctor’s referral to see a psychiatrist, and fees are covered by MSP. If you have a valid BC Services or CareCard, you do not need to pay to see a psychiatrist. \\n A registered psychologist focuses on different talk therapy or counselling approaches to treatments, but they don’t prescribe medication. They have graduate degrees in psychology. There are two different ways to access registered psychologists: the public system and the private system. Registered psychologists in the public system work in some hospitals or schools. You may need a doctor’s referral to access the program, and costs are usually covered by MSP. However, most people need to access registered psychologists through the private system. To do this, you can contact the psychologist yourself—you do not need a referral. Costs are not covered by MSP, but they may be covered by employee health plans. A registered psychologist’s fees charged by hour vary, and some offer lower fees to people with lower incomes. \\n You’ve probably noticed that a lot of the differences come down to how you pay for different services and how these professionals are educated. The practical differences in how they work are not always so clear. When it comes to your treatment and care, the most important part is finding a professional who supports your own goals. Are you really focused on fine-tuning medications? Are you looking for a particular therapy approach? Does the professional’s philosophy of care make sense to you? Do you like the professional you’re talking to and do you feel safe sharing your experiences? Ultimately, your relationship with the professional is what matters. Instead of focusing on designation, look for a professional who meets your needs and your expectations. \\n Talk to your family doctor and ask for their recommendations \\n Ask local mental health organizations for help.

       "  'Response': 'Psychotherapy and counselling have a lot in common and usually mean the same thing. Both are used to describe professionals who use talk-based approaches to help someone recover from a mental illness or mental health problem. Many different professionals may provide counselling or psychotherapy, including registered psychologists, registered clinical counsellors, psychiatrists, other therapists and counsellors, family doctors, psychiatric nurses, and faith leaders. \\n It’s useful to talk to someone about any problem—a lot of people find that simply talking with friends or family can help them feel better. A professional therapist or counsellor can offer more: they have training, experience, and emotional distance (since they don’t know you). They use different theories to listen to you, support you, and approach different problems or patterns. For example, a psychotherapy called cognitive-behavioural therapy is based on the theory that learning skills to change your thinking and actions can positively impact your emotions, well-being, and future thoughts and behaviours. A therapist could help you learn and practice these skills. \\n There are many psychotherapies with good evidence of being effective for different problems or illnesses. A few examples include cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, solutions-focused brief psychotherapy, narrative therapy, and emotion-focused therapy. \\n In general, some aspects of therapy and counselling are the same, no matter which approach you choose: the expectations you bring to your counselling sessions, the match between your understanding of the problems and your therapist’s understanding of the problem, and the trust and rapport that you have with your therapist. In fact, one research review found that 50% of the improvement seen in clients who just received active listening and support from a counsellor (called non-directive supportive therapy) was due simply to the relationship between client and therapist.1 Psychotherapy can and does work, but the professional you choose, and their match with your values, is also very important. \\n When you’re looking for a professional, it’s always a good idea to ask if they are a member of a professional organization (like those listed in the next section).'},\n",

       "  'Knowledge': '',\n",
       "  'Response': 'CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy) and DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) are two forms of psychotherapy or “talk therapy.” In both, you work with a mental health professional to learn more about the challenges you experience and learn skills to help you manage challenges on your own. \\n Cognitive-behavioural therapy or CBT teaches you how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours influence each other. For example, if you believe that people don’t like you (thought), you might avoid social situations (behaviour) and feel lonely (feeling). However, CBT teaches you how to use these relationships to your advantage: a positive change in one factor (changing a thought or behaviour) can lead to positive changes in all factors. CBT is an approach that has been proven by research to work for many different mental health problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and substance use problems. \\n CBT is structured, short-term, goal-oriented and focused on the present. It starts with education around the particular mental illness or challenge and how the illness or challenge affects you. Next, you’ll learn and practice skills and strategies like problem-solving or realistic thinking to help you make changes in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. You’ll learn how you can use your new skills to deal with problems in the future. \\n Dialectical behaviour therapy or DBT is based on CBT, with greater focus on emotional and social aspects. DBT was developed to help people cope with extreme or unstable emotions and harmful behaviours. DBT is an evidence-based approach to help people regulate emotions. It started as a treatment for borderline personality disorder, and current research shows it may help with many different mental illnesses or concerns, particularly self-harm. \\n Key differences between CBT and DBT are validation and relationships. DBT teaches you that your experiences are real, and it teaches you how to accept who you are, regardless of challenges or difficult experiences. Relationships are also very important in DBT—including the relationships between you and your DBT practitioner. You may have frequent check-ins to talk about any successes or problems. Treatment may include a mix of one-on-one sessions and group sessions. In addition to CBT skills, you’ll learn skills around managing your emotions, building relationships with others, coping well with problems or distress, acceptance, and mindfulness. \\n As with many talk therapies, it takes time and effort to enjoy the benefits of CBT and DBT skills. But once people master skills with support from your CBT or DBT therapist, they often find that their new skills and strategies become second nature—they are tools that last a lifetime.'},\n",

They are usually prescribed when newer antidepressants don’t work. Other medications such as lithium, thyroid medication, or antipsychotics may also be prescribed, often in combination with an antidepressant to boost its effect. Antidepressants are not only used to treat depression—they may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders. \\n Only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants. If your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants, keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication. It can be a frustrating process, especially when you feel unwell, but it’s important to find something that works for you! Side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people, and it’s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first.

This can be a tricky situation—you want to help, but most adults are responsible for their own care. \\n There are two important points to think about. First, diagnosing a health condition, especially when symptom-checking is so easy online, can be dangerous. Diagnosis is still always best left to professionals who can look at the whole picture. Remember, too, that the person you care about may have a very different idea of what’s causing their difficulties and what the negative impacts are on their life. Second, except in rare cases, the person being treated needs to be an active player in their own recovery to continue with their treatment, just as they would for any other health problem. If the vast majority of cases, you cannot do this work entirely for them—and trying to do so may damage your relationship. \\n Be honest about your concerns, the impacts you are seeing that worry you, listen to their point of view and work together to find a solution that works for everyone, even if it means a compromise. You may want to offer to go with them to an appointment, encourage them to do an online screening self-test, or involve someone else close to them who may be similarly concerned and may have more influence in encouraging them to notice changes and seek help. Because you may be feeling frustrated and helpless, it’s important to get care and support for yourself during this time, especially if you’re very close to the person you’re worried about. \\n In serious situations, the BC Mental Health Act allows someone to be held for a period of time for psychiatric assessment without their consent if they are at risk of harming themselves or others.

       "  'Response': 'We naturally want to help a loved one who isn’t feeling well. How we can or should help may seem fairly obvious when a loved one experiences a physical health problem, but many people say they’re not sure how to best help when a loved one experiences a mental illness like depression. Here are some tips: \\n You don’t have to understand exactly what someone else is experiencing, you just need to recognize that it’s a difficult experience. You can try something like, “I can see that this experience or these symptoms are really painful for you,” or, “I’m sorry to hear that you’re feeling unwell.” If you have experienced depression yourself, you might say, “I know how you feel.” Just remember that everyone experiences illnesses like depression differently, and empathy is about recognizing the impact of the illness, not comparing symptoms. \\n You don’t have to be an expert, but learning more about depression can help you understand what’s going on (and maybe dispel some of the unhelpful myths around depression). Our Depression info sheet is a great place to start, and we have a list of resources at Q&A: Where can I learn more about depression? \\n Sometimes talking about problems or concerns can really help—in fact, many people who experience a mood disorder say that they just want to be heard. It’s important to understand that talking about something difficult like experiences of depression can be very hard for your loved one. You cannot force them to talk about it, but you can invite them to, and create safe and quiet spaces to talk. If a loved one opens up to you, listen actively—that is, without distractions like your phone or the TV. Really pay attention to what they have to say. Listen with empathy and without judgement. Even if you don’t understand the problem or see the problem in a different way, your main concern is the distress or difficult feelings your loved one is experiencing. You can find in-depth tips on listening and communicating well in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not ready to talk about everything at once, or at all. That’s okay! Respect your loved one’s boundaries and let them tell you what they’re ready to talk about. \\n Even when you have the best intentions, unsolicited advice can be unhelpful. You likely can’t fix the problem, and you may not know the whole story. If you’d like to share what worked for you in a similar situation, you can ask if the other person would like to talk about strategies that worked for you. \\n Different people need different things—don’t assume you know what’s best! Some people need emotional help, like someone they can talk with. Other people may have a good relationship with a counsellor or other professional, but they might need practical help, like help around the house or help sticking to their treatment plan. And others may simply want to be included in some social events. By asking what a person needs, you may also be less tempted to give advice. \\n When people experience an episode of depression, they can have a lot of very negative thoughts and feelings. This can take a real toll on others. It’s a good idea to seek support for yourself—there are support groups just for family members and friends. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of family support groups around BC for any mental illness. \\n If your loved one isn’t happy with their treatment or would like to try a different option, you can also help them seek different resources or services. You can find general advice in the Ask Us section of HeretoHelp. To find local services, call the BC Mental Health Support Line at 310-6789 (no area code) or email us. \\n This is very important! You are not responsible for your loved one’s treatment (unless your loved one is your child under 19)—but you can support them as they work towards recovery. In most cases, your loved one’s treatment and recovery plans are their choice—you are there to offer support and encouragement. \\n In order for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to be actively involved. Forcing or threatening treatment generally doesn’t work and will only hurt everyone involved. In most cases, anyone 19 years of age and older is free to make their own choices. And their choices may include refusing treatment or choosing a treatment you disagree with. It’s important to be respectful and keep honest communication open between you. You can learn more about dealing with this situation in Ask Us: An adult in my life seems ill and won’t find help.

You can find in-depth tips on listening and communicating well in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not ready to talk about everything at once, or at all. That’s okay! Respect your loved one’s boundaries and let them tell you when they’re ready to talk. \\n Symptoms of schizophrenia like hallucinations (sensations that aren’t real, like hearing voices) or delusions (beliefs that can’t be true, like believing that you are being followed by a spy) can take some time to stop even when people are receiving treatment and following their treatment plan. As a group, these very distressing symptoms are called psychosis. Many people have a hard time responding to a loved one’s hallucinations or delusions. It’s best to avoid arguing about these experiences. Remember that delusion are symptoms of schizophrenia—they are not thoughts that you can talk someone out of. Telling someone that their experiences aren’t real or aren’t true doesn’t help when the experiences feel very real to that person! A better approach is to empathize with the feelings that hallucinations or delusions bring up—without confirming or denying the hallucination or delusion. For example, if a loved one is frustrated or upset when they hear voices, it isn’t helpful to say something like, “You’re okay! It isn’t real. I don’t hear anything.” Instead, you might say, “I can only image how upsetting that voice must be. I can see the voice makes you feel scared.” Know that with good treatment and support, symptoms like hallucinations and delusions become much easier for people to manage and lose importance. \\n Ask how you can help. When people experience a serious mental illness like schizophrenia, they may want to plan how they can take action if they start to feel unwell again, especially if they have dependent children. These plans, such as advanced directives or Ulysses Agreements, are made when a person feels well and are meant to communicate their wishes to loved ones and their care team. Ask your loved one if they have a plan in place so you know what they need if they need help. If you’d like to learn more about planning for care, see the BC Schizophrenia Society. \\n If a loved one is experiencing an episode of psychosis or is recovering for an episode of psychosis, they might need extra help. For example, people who are actively experiencing hallucinations or delusions might need a lot of personal space and feel uncomfortable being around a lot of people or even making eye contact. When people are recovering from an episode of psychosis, they may need a quiet space and a lot of rest. Sometimes people can get back into their usual routines fairly quickly, while other times it may take a lot of time (and effort) to get back into routines. Keep in mind that too much help can be a bit counterproductive. It may well be faster and easier for you to take care of your loved one’s tasks or chores yourself, but rebuilding activity and confidence are a big part of recovery. Encourage and support your loved one as they take on daily responsibilities, and let them tell you when they need extra help. \\n Schizophrenia can be a difficult illness—for everyone. During episodes of psychosis, your loved one may experience frightening sensations that you can’t understand. They may act in ways that you don’t understand. Other symptoms of schizophrenia can make it hard for people to express emotions or feelings, communicate clearly, or seem interested in others. It’s important to know that these are symptoms of an illness. They are no one’s fault, but they can still be hard to cope with. Consider reaching out to a family and friends support group for your own support. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of groups around BC at www.bcss.org/monthly-meetings-calendar/. \\n As a family member, it’s important to take care of yourself. Try to maintain your regular schedule and activities, such as your exercise routine and hobbies. Ask another family member or good friend to provide help with caregiving, especially in the early days of your loved one's illness. If you need help balancing time for self-care with caregiving duties, check out the BC Schizophrenia Society’s Family Respite Program. \\n Try to maintain your friendships or the network of people that you have in your life. These will later become important supports as your loved one recovers. Educate them and update them on your loved one's recovery. People are sometimes afraid to ask questions about schizophrenia and this will put them at ease. \\n This is very important! You are not responsible for your loved one’s treatment (unless your loved one is your child under 19), but you can support them. Schizophrenia can make it difficult for people to make and go to appointments and follow their treatment plan. With your loved one’s permission, you may choose to help by reminding them of appointments, taking them to appointments, or whatever helps in your situation. If your loved one isn’t happy with their treatment or would like to try a new approach, you can encourage them to talk with their care team, like their doctor or mental health team—it can be dangerous to stop or change a treatment without a doctor’s support. \\n Treatment can be a difficult area for loved ones. It’s hard to see someone you love in pain. You might be scared of the things your loved one is experiencing. You want to help. But in order for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to be active in their care. Forcing or threatening treatment generally doesn’t work (or if it does, in the case of an emergency, only for a short time) and can often hurt everyone involved. In most cases, anyone 19 years of age and older and not at risk of harm is free to make their own choices. And their choices may include refusing treatment or choosing a treatment that you disagree with. It helps everyone if you can be respectful and keep honest communication open between you. You can learn more about dealing with this situation in Q&A: An adult in my life seems ill and won’t find help. What can I do?. \\n If you think your loved one is at risk of harming themselves or others and they refuse help, it is possible to have them evaluated by a psychiatrist under the Mental Health Act. This process may involve police and other first responders, and it can be a difficult and stressful process for everyone. But it can also be a necessary step if someone is in danger. You can learn more about the Mental Health Act in the info sheet Families Coping with a Crisis and you can find the Guide to the Mental Health Act at www.health.gov.bc.ca/library/publications/year/2005/MentalHealthGuide.pdf.

       "  'Knowledge': '',\n",
       "  'Response': 'Using cannabis has the potential for benefits and harms. Young people use cannabis, like other psychoactive drugs, to feel good, to feel better, to do better or to explore. Trying cannabis out of curiosity, as an experiment, or while socializing with friends, is related to moderate use and lower potential for harm. Using cannabis to cope with daily life, deal with unpleasant feelings, or fit in with a social group has higher potential for harm. This is because dealing with these kinds of issues is associated with frequent and heavier use, less thought about potential harms and little consideration of alternatives for coping such as talking with a parent or trusted adult or physical activity with friends. \\n Evidence suggests that the younger a person is when they start using cannabis and the more often they use, the greater the potential for harms. The legal age to use cannabis in BC is 19. However, our brains do not finish developing until about age 25. Delaying cannabis use until early adulthood may reduce potential harmful effects on the brain. \\n Some young people, especially those with many factors predisposing them to serious and persistent mental health issues, should probably not use cannabis. Cannabis has been associated with an increased risk for psychosis and schizophrenia in this small group of people. Some people with serious mental health issues have also reported that using cannabis has helped them cope with their illness by helping them feel less anxious or stressed. As in most situations, balancing potential benefits and harms of using cannabis will be key for young people who have serious mental health concerns. \\n Mixing drugs, such as cannabis and alcohol, can also increase the possibility of experiencing harms. Intoxication may be more intense and long lasting and the young person may not appreciate how impaired they are. We often suggest, “Not too much, not too often, and only in a safe context” as a simple way to gauge your use of any psychoactive substance. \\n As a parent or caring adult, an open respectful relationship with a young person is one of your best resources and ways to prevent harms from substance use. Letting the youth know they can approach you at any time to talk about cannabis, other substances, or anything else of concern to them, says they matter to you and you are ready to listen and engage in dialogue with them. This is a great place to begin addressing anything that might come the young person’s way in life! \\n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

       "  'Knowledge': '',\n",
       "  'Response': '‘Mental health’ and ‘mental illness’ are increasingly being used as if they mean the same thing, but they do not. Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has health. As the World Health Organization famously says, “There is no health without mental health.” In the course of a lifetime, not all people will experience a mental illness, but everyone will struggle or have a challenge with their mental well-being (i.e., their mental health) just like we all have challenges with our physical well-being from time to time. \\n When we talk about mental health, we’re talking about our mental well-being: our emotions, our thoughts and feelings, our ability to solve problems and overcome difficulties, our social connections, and our understanding of the world around us. \\n A mental illness is an illness the affects that way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others. There are many different mental illnesses, and they have different symptoms that impact peoples’ lives in different ways. \\n Health isn’t like an on/off switch. There are different degrees of health. People move on a continuum ranging from great or good health to so-so health to poor health to illness or disability. For example, some people have good health and have no problems going about their lives. Some people experience serious health problems, and their poor health has a very negative impact on their life. Some people have serious health problems that last for a long time, and others have serious health problems that resolve very quickly. Many people fall somewhere in the middle—they’re generally in good health, though the occasional problem may come up. Mental health is the same way. \\n Just as someone who feels unwell may not have a serious illness, people may have poor mental health without a mental illness. We all have days where we feel a bit down, or stressed out, or overwhelmed by something that’s happening in our lives. An important part of good mental health is the ability to look at problems or concerns realistically. Good mental health isn’t about feeling happy and confident 100% of time and ignoring any problems. It’s about living and coping well despite problems. \\n Just as it’s possible to have poor mental health but no mental illness, it’s entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of a mental illness. That’s because mental illnesses (like other health problems) are often episodic, meaning there are times (‘episodes’) of ill health and times of better or good health. \\n With the right supports and tools, anyone can live well—however they define well—and find meaning, contribute to their communities, and work towards their goals.'},\n",

Anxiety is one of our internal warning systems that alerts us to danger or other threats and prepares our bodies to fight back or get out of a dangerous situation.

For example, it can motivate you to prepare for a test a school or finish a task at work. Even happy events like moving to a new home or celebrating an important milestone can bring up anxiety—all of this is just part of being human. \\n Anxiety is a problem when it becomes overwhelming or unmanageable and it comes up unexpectedly. Anxiety disorders are mental illnesses that have a big impact your life. People may avoid going about their daily lives in order to avoid anxiety. They may experience a lot of uncomfortable physical sensations and physical health problems.

Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we’re finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we’re stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. \\n Anxiety, on the other hand, isn’t always as easy to figure out.

Someone with ASPD may disregard laws or expectations, lack remorse when they hurt others or break the law, make reckless decisions, and believe they are superior to others. People may see someone with ASPD as overly dramatic, impulsive, manipulative, and deceitful. Some people may appear charming, at least on the surface. Like all mental illnesses, antisocial personality disorder is a spectrum. Some people may only occasionally act out, while others may break the law often and spend a lot of time in the criminal justice system. \\n ASPD is only diagnosed in adults, but people with ASPD start to have problems with conduct or antisocial behaviours at a young age. They may be diagnosed with conduct disorder during childhood. \\n Treatment for antisocial personality disorder, usually psychotherapy, can help reduce the harms of ASPD and help people build empathy towards others. ASPD is treatable and it may improve as a person approaches middle age. \\n All of us have hurt someone else or acted without thinking of others' needed.

People with OCPD have very inflexible thinking and expect everything to be ordered, perfect, and done their \"correct\" way. This happens at the expense of other important things in life, including relationships with others. Work can take priority over every other part of life, too, and people with OCPD may seem excessively dedicated, but may be unable to complete tasks due to perfectionism. They may struggle to delegate and may distrust other people’s contributions. People with OCPD may not tolerate uncertainty and may have a very rigid understanding of the world—something is either right or wrong. They may also have a hard time spending money on themselves or others, and they may experience hoarding, the inability to throw away items from their homes. The conflict between the desire for neatness or order and the inability to throw things out may cause a lot of anxiety. \\n While obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have a similar name, they are not the same illness.

Schizophrenia does mean “split mind,” but the name was meant to describe the ‘split’ from reality that you experience during an episode of psychosis, as well as changes in thoughts, emotions, and other functions. Dissociative identity disorder, on the other hand, does cause a split or fragmented understanding of a person’s sense of themselves. \\n Dissociative identity disorder is really more about fragmented identities than many different personalities that develop on their own. Most people see different parts of their being as part of the whole person. For people who experience DID, identity fragments may have very different characteristics, including their own history, identity, and mannerisms. A key part of DID is dissociation—feeling detached to the world around you. People who experience DID may have many unexplainable gaps in their memory, forget information they’re already learned, or have difficulties recalling things they’ve said or done. Unlike portrayals of DID on TV or in movies, DID may not be obvious to others, and it can take a lot of time to come to the diagnosis. \\n Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that causes hallucinations (sensations that aren’t real) and delusions (beliefs that can’t possibly be true, in addition to other symptoms like jumbled thoughts, jumbled speech, and difficulties expressing emotions. People who experience schizophrenia may hear or feel things that aren’t real or believe things that can’t be real, but these aren’t separate identities.'},\n",

Major symptoms of psychosis are hallucinations and delusions. Hallucinations are sensations that are not real, such as hearing voices or sounds that aren’t real. Hearing voices is a common hallucination, but hallucinations can be experiences with any sense—hearing, sight, smell, taste, or touch. Delusions are strong beliefs that can’t possibly be true. Common delusions include the belief that someone is following or monitoring you, or the belief that you have extraordinary powers or abilities. Other symptoms of psychosis include difficulties concentrating, completing tasks, or making decisions. Thoughts may feel ‘jumbled’ or confused. Some people have a hard time following conversations or speaking clearly. Psychosis can even affect the way people move or express their emotions. \\n Schizophrenia is a mental illness that causes psychosis, but schizophrenia also has other symptoms. And it isn’t the only cause of psychosis. In some cases, other mental illnesses cause psychosis, including depression, bipolar disorder, dementia and borderline personality disorder. Psychosis may come up during times of extreme stress, a major lack of sleep, or trauma. People who are using or withdrawing from certain drugs or medications may experience psychosis. Psychosis may also be caused by a brain injury, neurological problem, or other health problem.

       "  'Knowledge': '',\n",
       "  'Response': 'People tend to use the word “addiction” to mean very different things. “I am addicted to shopping” might mean only that the speaker likes to shop. On the other hand, “He is addicted” might mean the speaker thinks the other person is completely unable to control his own behaviour. When people use the word about psychoactive (mind-altering) substances like alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs, they often assume these drugs are dangerous and have the power to control human behaviour. \\n The evidence, however, suggests a quite different picture. While substance use can clearly contribute to health and social problems, substances can be beneficial for some people in some situations. Many people celebrate a special occasion with a nice glass of wine, for example. Some people use tobacco as a powerful symbol in cultural and spiritual ceremonies. In fact, substances have been used by humans throughout history for many reasons: to feel good, to feel better, to improve performance, for cultural/spiritual reasons, and to have new experiences. \\n Substance use is more complicated than just “good” or “bad.” It’s helpful to think of substance use along a continuum, from beneficial use to harmful use. Along the middle of the continuum, substance use may be both beneficial and harmful. You have an enjoyable night out with friends, but feel a little ill the next day. At the far end of the continuum, some people develop dependence—they need to continually use the drug in order to feel normal and will keep using even when that leads to financial difficulties, problems at home or at work, health problems, or legal problems. \\n In general, substance use is a problem when it causes problems for you or others—and how much use causes problems will be different for different people in different situations. The reason a person uses a substance influences the risk of developing problems. For instance, if a person uses a substance to have fun, only occasional social use may follow. But when a person uses a substance to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow. Managing our risk involves being aware of why we are using and what impacts our use is having on ourselves and those around us. The wisdom of our ancestors suggests a guiding principle—not too much, not too often, and only in safe contexts.'},\n",

No one has the same combination of life experiences and influences that you do. So even though you and your friend may choose to drink, how and why you use alcohol may be different. \\n Those of us who drink, seek benefits from alcohol, not difficulties. But sometimes we start using more, and more often, than makes sense. As a general rule, drinking alcohol becomes a problem when it negatively affects our life or the lives of others. Many people imagine this refers to people who consume alcohol “all day every day.” But even drinking too much on a single occasion can lead to a problem, for instance making a poor decision such as driving while impaired. \\n What’s also important to recognize is the potential for negative consequences related to drinking in various contexts (i.e., places, times and activities) and over time (e.g., coping with chronic problems).

The following are some useful guidelines to consider. \\n Not too much. Managing how much you drink on a given occasion helps decrease risky behaviours. \\n Tip: Drink slowly and alternate between non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. \\n Not too often. Drinking in moderation helps to reduce harms to ourselves and others over time. \\n Tip: Keep less alcohol at home and set limits on how much you are going to drink each week, avoiding drinking on some days. \\n Only in safe contexts. Making informed decisions about where you drink helps to minimize alcohol-related harm. \\n Tip: If going to a bar, stay with a group and choose an establishment that is well lit and near safe transportation options. \\n For information on treatment options and resources throughout BC, call the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service at 1-800-663-1441.

       "  'Response': 'Cannabis smoke, for example, contains cancer-causing toxins. However, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol. \\n Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17, 2018. Adults (over age 19 in BC) are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch. Cannabis will be tested for quality. \\n When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage the risks. However, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic. \\n The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. But as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm. \\n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

It's about helping your child develop the skills to assess what might be helpful in achieving their goals in life. It's also about nourishing a supportive relationship, so they know where to go with questions or problems. \\n Opening up a discussion about drugs can help strengthen your relationship with your child. Inviting and allowing open, honest conversation about drugs (or any other subject) makes your child know that what they are thinking, feeling and experiencing matters to you. The goal is to get your child talking and sharing their thoughts and feelings. \\n When young people are asked thoughtful, open-ended questions exploring what they think, it helps them become interested in their own thoughts and behaviour. This process of self-reflection is part of developing critical thinking skills, a part of good decision-making. Critical thinking skills are actually an essential part of reducing the risks related to using drugs. Once young people have considered something carefully, they are a lot less likely to act out of impulse or in response to influence. \\n There is no rule about how or where a conversation about alcohol or other drugs should start. Even young children know drugs are a part of our culture. They see people drinking around them and are exposed to drugs on TV and in advertising. This makes it a subject that can be brought up naturally while getting ready for a family celebration where alcohol will be present, or if you are planning to visit a relative who uses tobacco, or while swapping stories at the dinner table about what happened at work and school that day. \\n Talking with teens and young adults about drugs as they make choices on the path into adulthood helps them to develop personal standards, minimize risks and critically assess popular beliefs about drug use. This can be particularly important as they transition to the legal age for using alcohol or cannabis and move out of the family home.

       "  'Response': \"Cannabidiol or CBD is a naturally occurring component of cannabis. It is extracted from the cannabis plant and often made into an oil for use. CBD is not psychoactive, and does not produce the ‘high’ of THC (tetrahyrocannabinol), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. CBD is legal in Canada and has been used in the treatment of various medical conditions. \\n All cannabinoids, including CBD, produce effects in the body by attaching to certain receptors in the brain or immune system. The human body also produces its own cannabinoids. It seems that CBD does not attach directly to receptors. Instead, it directs the body to use more of its own cannabinoids to produce the therapeutic effects associated with CBD. \\n Research suggests that CBD may provide relief for chronic pain. Sativex is a proprietary medication that combines THC and CBD and may be prescribed for the relief of pain associated with multiple sclerosis. There is also some evidence suggesting that CBD may be a promising support for people with opioid use disorders. The researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders including anxiety, mood-related symptoms, pain, and insomnia. \\n After researching the safety and effectiveness of CBD oil for treating epilepsy, in 2018, the United States FDA approved CBD (Epidiolex) as a therapy for two rare conditions characterized by epileptic seizures. Other evidence suggests that CBD may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, though further research is needed before introducing CBD into medical practice. \\n There is some initial evidence that CBD may help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease keep the ability to recognize the faces of people that they know, and thus slow progression of the illness. Again, more research is needed in this area. \\n Because of the way cannabis and its products are metabolized, scientists believe there is a potential for interaction with other drugs, although nothing significant has yet been recorded. CBD has been found to be generally safe. Reports from patients indicate that negative drug interactions are not common. As with any other treatment, it is important to monitor your use of CBD and seek assistance if you experience any problems or have questions or concerns about its use. \\n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

       "  'Knowledge': '',\n",
       "  'Response': '\"Vaping\" is the term for using a device where liquids, often flavoured, are turned into vapour (hence, vaping) and inhaled. A vaping device consists of a mouthpiece, tank or reservoir to hold the liquid, a heating element and a battery to power the element. The liquid is heated to become a mist, inhaled through the mouth into the lungs where the nicotine or cannabis enters the bloodstream. Any residual vapour is exhaled. Vaping devices come in several types, shapes, and sizes, referred to as e-cigarettes, vape pens, vapes, mods, tanks, or e-hookahs. Vaping liquid (e-liquid, e-juice) consists of a solvent, usually propylene glycol or glycerol, flavour, and nicotine or cannabis, though it may not contain anything. In British Columbia you must be 19 years old to buy vaping products. \\n The number of young people who smoke cigarettes has declined over the past few years, while vaping has increased. E-cigarettes were developed as an alternative to smoking. The first devices were available in 2003 and looked much like a traditional cigarette. Nicotine vapour contains significantly fewer toxins and other particles than smoke from cigarettes. Vaping is a less harmful alternative to cigarettes and evidence suggests, it may help some people quit smoking. Evidence suggests vaping is likely not a gateway to smoking tobacco. \\n Though less harmful than smoking cigarettes, vaping still carries potential harms. There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour. (A carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer). Some evidence suggests that young people may be unaware the vaping liquid often contains nicotine. E-cigarettes are not controlled and the nicotine content of vaping liquids varies significantly among brands. Other chemicals, flavourings, and heavy metals present in vaping liquids, have not as yet been well studied. Long-term health risks from vaping are thus undetermined. More research is needed in these areas. \\n Marketing strategies for vaping products, often on social media, are designed to appeal to young people. The range of flavours available, especially those that are fruity and sweet, and the look and feel of vaping devices attract youth. Young people can see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and \\'smoke\\' in a less harmful way. \\n Making the time and space for discussion and exploring the issues around vaping is one important way we can support young people and indeed, each other, in making good decisions about if, when, or how much to vape. We offer, \"not too much, not too often, and in a safe context\" as one way to think about using any substance.

Um, and my role is to be helpful. I can share some information with you about alcohol use, um, but I don't tell anyone what to do. It's always up to the patient to decide what they wanna do about their drinking. Um, so is it okay if we talk a little bit more about your alcohol use? EOS So, uh, are you saying I drink too much? EOS How would you define drinking too much? EOS Well, I-- If-if I was getting fallen down drunk or if I drink every night. Um, it's not like I get sloppy drunk or anything. EOS Mm-hmm. Well, in this country, the guidelines are men can drink up to 14 drinks a week or up to four on one occasion and still be low risk. EOS So I'm already at the week limit. And then I have four beers a night. Are you sure? EOS So a limit of four a night doesn't feel right to you? EOS I have five or six beers when I go out with friends to a bar. It's not a problem for me. EOS You're not alone in feeling that way. Uh, binge drinking can feel normal to some people. EOS Well, I don't consider my drinking binge drinking. EOS Why is that? EOS I don't chug a lot of beers in a row. I have about five or six beers throughout the entire evening. EOS Mm-hmm. Well, technically, we define binge drinking as having more than four drinks on one occasion. EOS But I'm healthy. What health problems are you talking about? EOS Well, uh, we know if someone binge drinks over time, there's kind of two categories of risk. There's the short-term risk where someone who binge drinks is more likely to fall down, hurt themselves through an accident, uh, they're more likely to drive while under the influence. Uh, but over the long term, binge drinking can also, uh, cause things like heart disease, uh, different kinds of cancer, liver problems obviously, and then even mental health issues like depression and anxiety are more likely to happen. EOS Well, I didn't know about those things. EOS Can I ask you, uh, what do you like about drinking alcohol? EOS Well, I-I like beer. I like the way it tastes, I like the way it makes me feel. Uh, like when I'm around friends and it's not a problem for me. EOS And so what about your drinking do you not like or is there anything that worries you about your drinking? EOS Well, that was fine until I came here, uh, but now that I know about the health risk, uh, I have something I gotta think about. EOS So, on one hand, you like how beer tastes, uh, it's part of your social life to some extent, um, but on the other hand, you don't like the idea of it posing risks to your health over the long term? EOS E-exactly. EOS So weighing those things, you know, what you like about your drinking, what you don't like about your drinking, uh, where do you wanna go from here? Uh, what would you like to change about your drinking? EOS Hmm, I'm not sure. Uh, something I have to think about. EOS Well, how about hypothetically if I were to ask you, how would your drinking have to impact your life in order for you to be ready to change your drinking? EOS Uh, I don't know. Maybe if I got sick or something, uh, maybe I'd wanna change things then. EOS So if you experienced a negative consequence from your drinking, uh, that would feel meaningful to you? EOS Yeah.\",\n",

       " {'Context': \"Hi, John. Nice to see you again. So, tell me, how are things going? EOS Well, doc, I know you told me that I need to lose weight. And even though the scale didn't show today, I was able to lose about 5 pounds, but then I gained it right back. EOS Well, I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront. Do you mind if we explore this issue further? EOS No, by all means. I know we have to discuss it. EOS All right. Uh, well, it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently. And I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have it come back again. So, tell me what you did to lose that initial 5 pounds. EOS I started watching what I ate and I ate less. I've been eating more fruits and vegetables. I've also been walking a lot. I'm walking up to 20 minutes a day now. I saw the weight come slowly off, um, and I felt better. But then when I watched it come back on again, you know, I gave up. EOS But you did have some success. Tell me how you felt when you lost the weight. EOS I felt great and I felt really proud of myself. I thought that this was something that I could do. EOS Okay. Well, it sounds like you realized that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's gonna affect your overall health. So, tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back. EOS Well, I think it's because I've been eating more fruits and vegetables, that- that's it. EOS And how many servings of fruits and vegetables on average per day would you have? EOS To be honest, I have four or five -- four to six glasses of orange juice a day. Um, I have fruit for lunch and breakfast. I have, uh, usually one to two servings of a vegetable like lettuce or broccoli with thinner. EOS John, it's very important that you recognize that some fruits, but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories. Did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola? EOS No, I didn't know. Um, but doesn't the fruit- food pyramid classify, um, fruit juice as a- a serving? EOS You're absolutely right, but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only. When it comes to nutrition, we have to have a more personalized approach. So I have a hunch, and that is the excess fruit that you were consuming probably caused your weight rebound. What's your impression? EOS Well, this changes quite a bit. I mean, here I'm thinking that my fruit intake is making me healthier and actually it's making me fatter. EOS Indeed. Let me ask you something, knowing what you know now, how important is it to you to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking in? EOS Obviously, I need to cut back on the fruit juice. But boy, do I love that OJ. EOS Oh, I understand. Let me ask you this, on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 meaning that there's no way you can do it, and 10 meaning that you're 100% confident that you can do it, how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking in. EOS Um, six or seven. EOS All right. So, you're not a zero. So, that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable, this is something you certainly can do it. Why are you not a zero? EOS I guess it's because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight. EOS So, you realize, again, that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in, you're gonna decrease your weight, you're gonna feel better, and you're gonna impact your po- health positively? EOS Yes. EOS But you're also not a 10, and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success. What would it take for you to be a 10 or even an 8 or 9?

You know, I've been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you've made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we've been meeting? EOS Uh. Meeting's definitely helped. EOS Yeah? EOS Yeah. It's helped- EOS Yeah? EOS -heaps. EOS It's helped heaps? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with? EOS Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy? EOS Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that's a pretty big deal. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I'm wondering if the Billy of six months ago would've done that? EOS Nah. I didn't really think about it frankly. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What's shifted in you? EOS I don't know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it'll make things easier. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time. EOS Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that's just really helpful. EOS Mm-hmm.

If— EOS So, what needs to happen next? EOS Just take them in. EOS So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you? EOS Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I'll just drop them in. EOS Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you're gonna do that? EOS Uh, probably by the end of this week. EOS Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech? EOS Yeah. EOS And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there? EOS I don't know. I don't know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don't even know any course that I'll do. EOS Mm-hmm. So what's the- what's the-- Say, if you get on the course- EOS Yeah. EOS -and, um, you're, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don't feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that? EOS Well, um-- Well, I don't know. Hopefully, there's not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don't know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something. EOS Mm. Yeah? EOS Yeah. EOS So, all these changes that you've- that you've made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now? EOS Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way. EOS So, offending gets in the way of the life that you're starting to lead? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending?

EOS So you've noticed that when you've been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or? EOS Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It's kind of harder to think straight.

EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. What would happen if she wasn't around say or at a party or? EOS I'd probably just go be stupid with my mates. EOS Okay.

EOS So you've noticed that when you've been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or? EOS Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It's kind of harder to think straight. EOS It's harder to think straight when you've been drinking? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Yeah. And so you've got Donna around at the moment? EOS Yeah. EOS And that's helping keep you in check, as you said? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. What would happen if she wasn't around say or at a party or? EOS I'd probably just go be stupid with my mates. EOS Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength? EOS Yeah. 'Cause if there's just like if a mate said they're gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don't know. She say that's stupid and stuff. And I don't know. It gives me something to do. EOS Mm. What do you think? EOS Just kind of stupid. Well, it's pointless, but still a bit of a laugh. EOS Mm. Yeah. 'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you've got about the job and a life with Donna and- EOS Mm. EOS -kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn't fit in with that dream or that idea. EOS No. EOS So there's that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there's the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you've had a few to drink and you're with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh? EOS Yeah. EOS So you've got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah? EOS Mm. EOS And it sounds like sometimes when you're in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it's hard to hold on to that vision of the future. EOS Yeah. You don't really think about that. Well, just in the moment. EOS Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking? EOS Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking.

You know, I've been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you've made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we've been meeting? EOS Uh. Meeting's definitely helped. EOS Yeah? EOS Yeah. It's helped- EOS Yeah? EOS -heaps. EOS It's helped heaps? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with? EOS Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy? EOS Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that's a pretty big deal. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago.

So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What's shifted in you? EOS I don't know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it'll make things easier. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time. EOS Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that's just really helpful. EOS Mm-hmm.

If— EOS So, what needs to happen next? EOS Just take them in. EOS So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you? EOS Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I'll just drop them in. EOS Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you're gonna do that? EOS Uh, probably by the end of this week. EOS Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech? EOS Yeah. EOS And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there? EOS I don't know. I don't know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don't even know any course that I'll do. EOS Mm-hmm. So what's the- what's the-- Say, if you get on the course- EOS Yeah. EOS -and, um, you're, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don't feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that? EOS Well, um-- Well, I don't know. Hopefully, there's not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don't know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something. EOS Mm. Yeah?

So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you\\'ve made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we\\'ve been meeting? EOS Uh. Meeting\\'s definitely helped. EOS Yeah? EOS Yeah. It\\'s helped- EOS Yeah? EOS -heaps. EOS It\\'s helped heaps? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with? EOS Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy? EOS Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that\\'s a pretty big deal. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I\\'m wondering if the Billy of six months ago would\\'ve done that? EOS Nah. I didn\\'t really think about it frankly. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What\\'s shifted in you? EOS I don\\'t know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it\\'ll make things easier. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time. EOS Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that\\'s just really helpful. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS  if I\\'d got into polytech and stuff, so I think that\\'s good. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS So, where are the forms now? EOS They\\'re still at home. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. If— EOS So, what needs to happen next? EOS Just take them in. EOS So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you? EOS Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I\\'ll just drop them in. EOS Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you\\'re gonna do that? EOS Uh, probably by the end of this week. EOS Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech? EOS Yeah. EOS And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there? EOS I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don\\'t even know any course that I\\'ll do. EOS Mm-hmm. So what\\'s the- what\\'s the-- Say, if you get on the course- EOS Yeah. EOS -and, um, you\\'re, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don\\'t feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that? EOS Well, um-- Well, I don\\'t know. Hopefully, there\\'s not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don\\'t know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something. EOS Mm. Yeah? EOS Yeah. EOS So, all these changes that you\\'ve- that you\\'ve made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now? EOS Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way. EOS So, offending gets in the way of the life that you\\'re starting to lead? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending? EOS Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy. EOS Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend. EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve noticed that when you\\'ve been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or? EOS Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It\\'s kind of harder to think straight. EOS It\\'s harder to think straight when you\\'ve been drinking? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Yeah. And so you\\'ve got Donna around at the moment? EOS Yeah. EOS And that\\'s helping keep you in check, as you said? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. What would happen if she wasn\\'t around say or at a party or? EOS I\\'d probably just go be stupid with my mates. EOS Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength? EOS Yeah. \\'Cause if there\\'s just like if a mate said they\\'re gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don\\'t know. She say that\\'s stupid and stuff. And I don\\'t know. It gives me something to do. EOS Mm. What do you think? EOS Just kind of stupid. Well, it\\'s pointless, but still a bit of a laugh. EOS Mm. Yeah. \\'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you\\'ve got about the job and a life with Donna and- EOS Mm. EOS -kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn\\'t fit in with that dream or that idea. EOS No. EOS So there\\'s that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there\\'s the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you\\'ve had a few to drink and you\\'re with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh? EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah? EOS Mm. EOS And it sounds like sometimes when you\\'re in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it\\'s hard to hold on to that vision of the future. EOS Yeah. You don\\'t really think about that. Well, just in the moment. EOS Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking? EOS Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking. EOS Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next- EOS Mm. EOS -kind of minute or so- EOS No. Just, like, it\\'s not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah. EOS So it\\'s not your idea. And you also go along with it? EOS Yeah. You can\\'t really be like, \"Oh no,\" just give me shit. EOS Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no? EOS Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don\\'t know. And they\\'d talk me into it probably. EOS Mm-hmm. So it\\'s hard to actually say no to your friends- EOS Yeah.

So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you\\'ve made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we\\'ve been meeting? EOS Uh. Meeting\\'s definitely helped. EOS Yeah? EOS Yeah. It\\'s helped- EOS Yeah? EOS -heaps. EOS It\\'s helped heaps? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with? EOS Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy? EOS Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that\\'s a pretty big deal. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I\\'m wondering if the Billy of six months ago would\\'ve done that? EOS Nah. I didn\\'t really think about it frankly. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What\\'s shifted in you? EOS I don\\'t know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it\\'ll make things easier. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time. EOS Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that\\'s just really helpful. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS  if I\\'d got into polytech and stuff, so I think that\\'s good. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS So, where are the forms now? EOS They\\'re still at home. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. If— EOS So, what needs to happen next? EOS Just take them in. EOS So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you? EOS Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I\\'ll just drop them in. EOS Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you\\'re gonna do that? EOS Uh, probably by the end of this week. EOS Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech? EOS Yeah. EOS And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there? EOS I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don\\'t even know any course that I\\'ll do. EOS Mm-hmm. So what\\'s the- what\\'s the-- Say, if you get on the course- EOS Yeah. EOS -and, um, you\\'re, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don\\'t feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that? EOS Well, um-- Well, I don\\'t know. Hopefully, there\\'s not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don\\'t know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something. EOS Mm. Yeah? EOS Yeah. EOS So, all these changes that you\\'ve- that you\\'ve made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now? EOS Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way. EOS So, offending gets in the way of the life that you\\'re starting to lead? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending? EOS Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy. EOS Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend. EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve noticed that when you\\'ve been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or? EOS Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It\\'s kind of harder to think straight. EOS It\\'s harder to think straight when you\\'ve been drinking? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Yeah. And so you\\'ve got Donna around at the moment? EOS Yeah. EOS And that\\'s helping keep you in check, as you said? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. What would happen if she wasn\\'t around say or at a party or? EOS I\\'d probably just go be stupid with my mates. EOS Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength? EOS Yeah. \\'Cause if there\\'s just like if a mate said they\\'re gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don\\'t know. She say that\\'s stupid and stuff. And I don\\'t know. It gives me something to do. EOS Mm. What do you think? EOS Just kind of stupid. Well, it\\'s pointless, but still a bit of a laugh. EOS Mm. Yeah. \\'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you\\'ve got about the job and a life with Donna and- EOS Mm. EOS -kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn\\'t fit in with that dream or that idea. EOS No. EOS So there\\'s that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there\\'s the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you\\'ve had a few to drink and you\\'re with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh? EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah? EOS Mm. EOS And it sounds like sometimes when you\\'re in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it\\'s hard to hold on to that vision of the future. EOS Yeah. You don\\'t really think about that. Well, just in the moment. EOS Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking? EOS Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking. EOS Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next- EOS Mm. EOS -kind of minute or so- EOS No. Just, like, it\\'s not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah. EOS So it\\'s not your idea. And you also go along with it? EOS Yeah. You can\\'t really be like, \"Oh no,\" just give me shit. EOS Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no? EOS Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don\\'t know. And they\\'d talk me into it probably. EOS Mm-hmm. So it\\'s hard to actually say no to your friends- EOS Yeah. EOS -\\'cause of what they- what they thought of you. EOS They\\'d just think I was joking, yeah. EOS Yeah. So I\\'m wondering what the-the thinking, \\'cause, um, one of the things that\\'s really changed for you is being with Donna. EOS Yeah. EOS So I\\'m wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys. EOS I don\\'t see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so- EOS Mm-hmm.

EOS -kind of minute or so- EOS No. Just, like, it\\'s not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah. EOS So it\\'s not your idea. And you also go along with it? EOS Yeah. You can\\'t really be like, \"Oh no,\" just give me shit. EOS Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no? EOS Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don\\'t know. And they\\'d talk me into it probably. EOS Mm-hmm. So it\\'s hard to actually say no to your friends- EOS Yeah. EOS -\\'cause of what they- what they thought of you. EOS They\\'d just think I was joking, yeah. EOS Yeah.

EOS So I\\'m wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys. EOS I don\\'t see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so- EOS Mm-hmm.

You know, I\\'ve been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now.

EOS Yeah. It\\'s helped- EOS Yeah? EOS -heaps. EOS It\\'s helped heaps? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with? EOS Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy? EOS Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that\\'s a pretty big deal. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I\\'m wondering if the Billy of six months ago would\\'ve done that? EOS Nah. I didn\\'t really think about it frankly. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What\\'s shifted in you? EOS I don\\'t know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it\\'ll make things easier. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time. EOS Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that\\'s just really helpful. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS  if I\\'d got into polytech and stuff, so I think that\\'s good. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS So, where are the forms now? EOS They\\'re still at home. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. If— EOS So, what needs to happen next? EOS Just take them in. EOS So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you? EOS Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I\\'ll just drop them in. EOS Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you\\'re gonna do that? EOS Uh, probably by the end of this week. EOS Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech? EOS Yeah. EOS And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there? EOS I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don\\'t even know any course that I\\'ll do. EOS Mm-hmm. So what\\'s the- what\\'s the-- Say, if you get on the course- EOS Yeah. EOS -and, um, you\\'re, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don\\'t feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that? EOS Well, um-- Well, I don\\'t know. Hopefully, there\\'s not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don\\'t know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something. EOS Mm. Yeah? EOS Yeah. EOS So, all these changes that you\\'ve- that you\\'ve made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now? EOS Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way. EOS So, offending gets in the way of the life that you\\'re starting to lead? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending? EOS Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy. EOS Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend. EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve noticed that when you\\'ve been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or? EOS Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It\\'s kind of harder to think straight. EOS It\\'s harder to think straight when you\\'ve been drinking? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Yeah. And so you\\'ve got Donna around at the moment? EOS Yeah. EOS And that\\'s helping keep you in check, as you said? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. What would happen if she wasn\\'t around say or at a party or? EOS I\\'d probably just go be stupid with my mates. EOS Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength? EOS Yeah. \\'Cause if there\\'s just like if a mate said they\\'re gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don\\'t know. She say that\\'s stupid and stuff. And I don\\'t know. It gives me something to do. EOS Mm. What do you think? EOS Just kind of stupid. Well, it\\'s pointless, but still a bit of a laugh. EOS Mm. Yeah. \\'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you\\'ve got about the job and a life with Donna and- EOS Mm. EOS -kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn\\'t fit in with that dream or that idea. EOS No. EOS So there\\'s that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there\\'s the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you\\'ve had a few to drink and you\\'re with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh? EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah? EOS Mm. EOS And it sounds like sometimes when you\\'re in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it\\'s hard to hold on to that vision of the future. EOS Yeah. You don\\'t really think about that.

EOS Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you\\'re gonna do that? EOS Uh, probably by the end of this week. EOS Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech? EOS Yeah. EOS And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there? EOS I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don\\'t even know any course that I\\'ll do. EOS Mm-hmm. So what\\'s the- what\\'s the-- Say, if you get on the course- EOS Yeah. EOS -and, um, you\\'re, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don\\'t feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that? EOS Well, um-- Well, I don\\'t know. Hopefully, there\\'s not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don\\'t know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something. EOS Mm. Yeah? EOS Yeah. EOS So, all these changes that you\\'ve- that you\\'ve made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now? EOS Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way. EOS So, offending gets in the way of the life that you\\'re starting to lead? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending? EOS Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy. EOS Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend. EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve noticed that when you\\'ve been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or? EOS Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It\\'s kind of harder to think straight. EOS It\\'s harder to think straight when you\\'ve been drinking? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Yeah. And so you\\'ve got Donna around at the moment? EOS Yeah. EOS And that\\'s helping keep you in check, as you said? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. What would happen if she wasn\\'t around say or at a party or? EOS I\\'d probably just go be stupid with my mates. EOS Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength? EOS Yeah. \\'Cause if there\\'s just like if a mate said they\\'re gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don\\'t know. She say that\\'s stupid and stuff. And I don\\'t know. It gives me something to do. EOS Mm. What do you think? EOS Just kind of stupid. Well, it\\'s pointless, but still a bit of a laugh. EOS Mm. Yeah. \\'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you\\'ve got about the job and a life with Donna and- EOS Mm. EOS -kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn\\'t fit in with that dream or that idea. EOS No. EOS So there\\'s that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there\\'s the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you\\'ve had a few to drink and you\\'re with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh? EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah? EOS Mm. EOS And it sounds like sometimes when you\\'re in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it\\'s hard to hold on to that vision of the future. EOS Yeah. You don\\'t really think about that. Well, just in the moment. EOS Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking? EOS Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking. EOS Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next- EOS Mm. EOS -kind of minute or so- EOS No. Just, like, it\\'s not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah. EOS So it\\'s not your idea. And you also go along with it? EOS Yeah. You can\\'t really be like, \"Oh no,\" just give me shit. EOS Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no? EOS Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don\\'t know. And they\\'d talk me into it probably. EOS Mm-hmm. So it\\'s hard to actually say no to your friends- EOS Yeah. EOS -\\'cause of what they- what they thought of you. EOS They\\'d just think I was joking, yeah. EOS Yeah. So I\\'m wondering what the-the thinking, \\'cause, um, one of the things that\\'s really changed for you is being with Donna. EOS Yeah. EOS So I\\'m wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys. EOS I don\\'t see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so- EOS Mm-hmm. EOS I don\\'t think, like, I am not sure they like it. EOS Then so when you\\'re-- so you\\'re spending less time with them and more time with Donna? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And you\\'re saying you\\'re kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you\\'re spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past? EOS They don\\'t lead me into trouble. But- EOS Okay. So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it. EOS Uh, like it\\'s my choice though, they don\\'t make me. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. I know it\\'s just having grown up with, it\\'s just what we\\'ve always done. EOS Okay. So that\\'s just what you\\'ve always done. EOS Yeah. EOS But we\\'re also talking about this idea that it doesn\\'t fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are? EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be? EOS My life? Well, what do you mean? EOS Mm, well the stuff about when you\\'re in the moment. Yeah. EOS Yeah.',\n",

EOS No. EOS So there\\'s that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there\\'s the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you\\'ve had a few to drink and you\\'re with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh? EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah? EOS Mm. EOS And it sounds like sometimes when you\\'re in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it\\'s hard to hold on to that vision of the future. EOS Yeah. You don\\'t really think about that. Well, just in the moment. EOS Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking? EOS Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking. EOS Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next- EOS Mm. EOS -kind of minute or so- EOS No. Just, like, it\\'s not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah. EOS So it\\'s not your idea. And you also go along with it? EOS Yeah. You can\\'t really be like, \"Oh no,\" just give me shit. EOS Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no? EOS Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don\\'t know. And they\\'d talk me into it probably. EOS Mm-hmm. So it\\'s hard to actually say no to your friends- EOS Yeah. EOS -\\'cause of what they- what they thought of you. EOS They\\'d just think I was joking, yeah. EOS Yeah. So I\\'m wondering what the-the thinking, \\'cause, um, one of the things that\\'s really changed for you is being with Donna. EOS Yeah. EOS So I\\'m wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys. EOS I don\\'t see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so- EOS Mm-hmm. EOS I don\\'t think, like, I am not sure they like it. EOS Then so when you\\'re-- so you\\'re spending less time with them and more time with Donna? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And you\\'re saying you\\'re kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you\\'re spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past? EOS They don\\'t lead me into trouble. But- EOS Okay. So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it. EOS Uh, like it\\'s my choice though, they don\\'t make me. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. I know it\\'s just having grown up with, it\\'s just what we\\'ve always done. EOS Okay. So that\\'s just what you\\'ve always done. EOS Yeah. EOS But we\\'re also talking about this idea that it doesn\\'t fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are? EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be? EOS My life? Well, what do you mean? EOS Mm, well the stuff about when you\\'re in the moment. Yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS When you\\'ve had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble. How would you like that to be different? EOS I don\\'t know. Just more or less like if Donna was there and maybe if my mates got some girlfriends or something like that would calm them down too. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS So just hang out instead of go and do stuff, like stupid stuff. EOS Okay. So-so Donna\\'s helped calm you down and you\\'d like, um, them to calm down too? EOS Yeah, \\'cause then we could hang out together and stuff-',\n",

EOS You\\'ve done-- You\\'ve got a really good track record of, uh, being on time. Yeah? Do you realize that? EOS Yeah, no, it\\'s easy. EOS Yeah. Yeah. You know, I\\'ve been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you\\'ve made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we\\'ve been meeting? EOS Uh. Meeting\\'s definitely helped. EOS Yeah? EOS Yeah. It\\'s helped- EOS Yeah? EOS -heaps. EOS It\\'s helped heaps? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with? EOS Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy? EOS Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that\\'s a pretty big deal. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I\\'m wondering if the Billy of six months ago would\\'ve done that? EOS Nah. I didn\\'t really think about it frankly. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What\\'s shifted in you? EOS I don\\'t know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it\\'ll make things easier. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time. EOS Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that\\'s just really helpful. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS  if I\\'d got into polytech and stuff, so I think that\\'s good. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS So, where are the forms now? EOS They\\'re still at home. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. If— EOS So, what needs to happen next? EOS Just take them in. EOS So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you? EOS Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I\\'ll just drop them in. EOS Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you\\'re gonna do that? EOS Uh, probably by the end of this week. EOS Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech? EOS Yeah. EOS And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there? EOS I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don\\'t even know any course that I\\'ll do. EOS Mm-hmm. So what\\'s the- what\\'s the-- Say, if you get on the course- EOS Yeah. EOS -and, um, you\\'re, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don\\'t feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that? EOS Well, um-- Well, I don\\'t know. Hopefully, there\\'s not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don\\'t know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something. EOS Mm. Yeah? EOS Yeah. EOS So, all these changes that you\\'ve- that you\\'ve made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now? EOS Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way. EOS So, offending gets in the way of the life that you\\'re starting to lead? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending? EOS Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy. EOS Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend. EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve noticed that when you\\'ve been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or? EOS Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It\\'s kind of harder to think straight. EOS It\\'s harder to think straight when you\\'ve been drinking? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Yeah. And so you\\'ve got Donna around at the moment? EOS Yeah. EOS And that\\'s helping keep you in check, as you said? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. What would happen if she wasn\\'t around say or at a party or? EOS I\\'d probably just go be stupid with my mates. EOS Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength? EOS Yeah. \\'Cause if there\\'s just like if a mate said they\\'re gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don\\'t know. She say that\\'s stupid and stuff. And I don\\'t know. It gives me something to do. EOS Mm. What do you think? EOS Just kind of stupid. Well, it\\'s pointless, but still a bit of a laugh. EOS Mm. Yeah. \\'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you\\'ve got about the job and a life with Donna and- EOS Mm.

So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it. EOS Uh, like it\\'s my choice though, they don\\'t make me. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. I know it\\'s just having grown up with, it\\'s just what we\\'ve always done. EOS Okay. So that\\'s just what you\\'ve always done. EOS Yeah. EOS But we\\'re also talking about this idea that it doesn\\'t fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are? EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be? EOS My life? Well, what do you mean? EOS Mm, well the stuff about when you\\'re in the moment. Yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS When you\\'ve had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble. How would you like that to be different? EOS I don\\'t know. Just more or less like if Donna was there and maybe if my mates got some girlfriends or something like that would calm them down too. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS So just hang out instead of go and do stuff, like stupid stuff. EOS Okay. So-so Donna\\'s helped calm you down and you\\'d like, um, them to calm down too? EOS Yeah, \\'cause then we could hang out together and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -with our girlfriends and stuff. EOS So am I hearing that it\\'s tricky in some ways to hang out with them sometimes- EOS Yeah. EOS -now that you\\'re with Donna? EOS Yeah. Cause I like I feel guilty not spending my time with, yeah, Donna. Like, I miss my mates, like, I get lonely and stuff, but even though they get me into trouble, but-',\n",

EOS You\\'ve done-- You\\'ve got a really good track record of, uh, being on time. Yeah? Do you realize that? EOS Yeah, no, it\\'s easy. EOS Yeah. Yeah. You know, I\\'ve been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you\\'ve made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we\\'ve been meeting? EOS Uh. Meeting\\'s definitely helped. EOS Yeah? EOS Yeah. It\\'s helped- EOS Yeah? EOS -heaps. EOS It\\'s helped heaps? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with? EOS Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy? EOS Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that\\'s a pretty big deal. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I\\'m wondering if the Billy of six months ago would\\'ve done that? EOS Nah. I didn\\'t really think about it frankly. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What\\'s shifted in you? EOS I don\\'t know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it\\'ll make things easier. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time. EOS Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that\\'s just really helpful. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS  if I\\'d got into polytech and stuff, so I think that\\'s good. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS So, where are the forms now? EOS They\\'re still at home. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. If— EOS So, what needs to happen next? EOS Just take them in. EOS So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you? EOS Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I\\'ll just drop them in. EOS Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you\\'re gonna do that? EOS Uh, probably by the end of this week. EOS Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech? EOS Yeah. EOS And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there? EOS I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don\\'t even know any course that I\\'ll do. EOS Mm-hmm. So what\\'s the- what\\'s the-- Say, if you get on the course- EOS Yeah. EOS -and, um, you\\'re, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don\\'t feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that? EOS Well, um-- Well, I don\\'t know. Hopefully, there\\'s not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don\\'t know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something. EOS Mm. Yeah? EOS Yeah. EOS So, all these changes that you\\'ve- that you\\'ve made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now? EOS Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way. EOS So, offending gets in the way of the life that you\\'re starting to lead? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending? EOS Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy. EOS Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend. EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve noticed that when you\\'ve been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or? EOS Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It\\'s kind of harder to think straight. EOS It\\'s harder to think straight when you\\'ve been drinking? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Yeah. And so you\\'ve got Donna around at the moment? EOS Yeah. EOS And that\\'s helping keep you in check, as you said? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. What would happen if she wasn\\'t around say or at a party or? EOS I\\'d probably just go be stupid with my mates. EOS Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength? EOS Yeah. \\'Cause if there\\'s just like if a mate said they\\'re gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don\\'t know. She say that\\'s stupid and stuff. And I don\\'t know. It gives me something to do. EOS Mm. What do you think? EOS Just kind of stupid. Well, it\\'s pointless, but still a bit of a laugh. EOS Mm. Yeah. \\'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you\\'ve got about the job and a life with Donna and- EOS Mm. EOS -kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn\\'t fit in with that dream or that idea. EOS No. EOS So there\\'s that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there\\'s the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you\\'ve had a few to drink and you\\'re with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh? EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah? EOS Mm. EOS And it sounds like sometimes when you\\'re in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it\\'s hard to hold on to that vision of the future. EOS Yeah. You don\\'t really think about that. Well, just in the moment. EOS Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking? EOS Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking. EOS Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next- EOS Mm. EOS -kind of minute or so- EOS No. Just, like, it\\'s not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah. EOS So it\\'s not your idea. And you also go along with it? EOS Yeah. You can\\'t really be like, \"Oh no,\" just give me shit. EOS Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no? EOS Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don\\'t know. And they\\'d talk me into it probably. EOS Mm-hmm. So it\\'s hard to actually say no to your friends- EOS Yeah. EOS -\\'cause of what they- what they thought of you. EOS They\\'d just think I was joking, yeah. EOS Yeah. So I\\'m wondering what the-the thinking, \\'cause, um, one of the things that\\'s really changed for you is being with Donna. EOS Yeah. EOS So I\\'m wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys. EOS I don\\'t see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so- EOS Mm-hmm. EOS I don\\'t think, like, I am not sure they like it. EOS Then so when you\\'re-- so you\\'re spending less time with them and more time with Donna? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And you\\'re saying you\\'re kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you\\'re spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past? EOS They don\\'t lead me into trouble. But- EOS Okay.

EOS Yeah, \\'cause then we could hang out together and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -with our girlfriends and stuff. EOS So am I hearing that it\\'s tricky in some ways to hang out with them sometimes- EOS Yeah. EOS -now that you\\'re with Donna? EOS Yeah. Cause I like I feel guilty not spending my time with, yeah, Donna. Like, I miss my mates, like, I get lonely and stuff, but even though they get me into trouble, but- EOS Hmm. EOS -just, kind of, feel stoked that-that I see them on the weekends and stuff. EOS Okay. So-so what\\'s the definition, for you, of a good mate? EOS It\\'s, like, loyal- EOS Mm-hmm.

       " {'Context': 'Hi, Billy. EOS Hi. EOS Hi, another session and another session where you are actually on time. EOS Yeah. EOS You\\'ve done-- You\\'ve got a really good track record of, uh, being on time. Yeah? Do you realize that? EOS Yeah, no, it\\'s easy. EOS Yeah. Yeah. You know, I\\'ve been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you\\'ve made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we\\'ve been meeting? EOS Uh. Meeting\\'s definitely helped. EOS Yeah? EOS Yeah. It\\'s helped- EOS Yeah? EOS -heaps. EOS It\\'s helped heaps? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with? EOS Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy? EOS Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that\\'s a pretty big deal. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I\\'m wondering if the Billy of six months ago would\\'ve done that? EOS Nah. I didn\\'t really think about it frankly. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What\\'s shifted in you? EOS I don\\'t know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it\\'ll make things easier. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time. EOS Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that\\'s just really helpful. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS  if I\\'d got into polytech and stuff, so I think that\\'s good. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS So, where are the forms now? EOS They\\'re still at home. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. If— EOS So, what needs to happen next? EOS Just take them in. EOS So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you? EOS Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I\\'ll just drop them in. EOS Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you\\'re gonna do that? EOS Uh, probably by the end of this week. EOS Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech? EOS Yeah. EOS And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there? EOS I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don\\'t even know any course that I\\'ll do. EOS Mm-hmm. So what\\'s the- what\\'s the-- Say, if you get on the course- EOS Yeah. EOS -and, um, you\\'re, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don\\'t feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that? EOS Well, um-- Well, I don\\'t know. Hopefully, there\\'s not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don\\'t know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something. EOS Mm. Yeah? EOS Yeah. EOS So, all these changes that you\\'ve- that you\\'ve made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now? EOS Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way. EOS So, offending gets in the way of the life that you\\'re starting to lead? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending? EOS Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy. EOS Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend. EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve noticed that when you\\'ve been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or? EOS Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It\\'s kind of harder to think straight. EOS It\\'s harder to think straight when you\\'ve been drinking? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Yeah. And so you\\'ve got Donna around at the moment? EOS Yeah. EOS And that\\'s helping keep you in check, as you said? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. What would happen if she wasn\\'t around say or at a party or? EOS I\\'d probably just go be stupid with my mates. EOS Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength? EOS Yeah. \\'Cause if there\\'s just like if a mate said they\\'re gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don\\'t know. She say that\\'s stupid and stuff. And I don\\'t know. It gives me something to do. EOS Mm. What do you think? EOS Just kind of stupid. Well, it\\'s pointless, but still a bit of a laugh. EOS Mm. Yeah. \\'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you\\'ve got about the job and a life with Donna and- EOS Mm. EOS -kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn\\'t fit in with that dream or that idea. EOS No. EOS So there\\'s that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there\\'s the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you\\'ve had a few to drink and you\\'re with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh? EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah? EOS Mm. EOS And it sounds like sometimes when you\\'re in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it\\'s hard to hold on to that vision of the future. EOS Yeah. You don\\'t really think about that. Well, just in the moment. EOS Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking? EOS Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking. EOS Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next- EOS Mm. EOS -kind of minute or so- EOS No. Just, like, it\\'s not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah. EOS So it\\'s not your idea. And you also go along with it? EOS Yeah. You can\\'t really be like, \"Oh no,\" just give me shit. EOS Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no? EOS Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don\\'t know. And they\\'d talk me into it probably. EOS Mm-hmm. So it\\'s hard to actually say no to your friends- EOS Yeah. EOS -\\'cause of what they- what they thought of you. EOS They\\'d just think I was joking, yeah. EOS Yeah. So I\\'m wondering what the-the thinking, \\'cause, um, one of the things that\\'s really changed for you is being with Donna. EOS Yeah. EOS So I\\'m wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys. EOS I don\\'t see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so- EOS Mm-hmm. EOS I don\\'t think, like, I am not sure they like it. EOS Then so when you\\'re-- so you\\'re spending less time with them and more time with Donna? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And you\\'re saying you\\'re kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you\\'re spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past? EOS They don\\'t lead me into trouble. But- EOS Okay. So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it. EOS Uh, like it\\'s my choice though, they don\\'t make me. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. I know it\\'s just having grown up with, it\\'s just what we\\'ve always done. EOS Okay. So that\\'s just what you\\'ve always done. EOS Yeah. EOS But we\\'re also talking about this idea that it doesn\\'t fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are? EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be? EOS My life? Well, what do you mean? EOS Mm, well the stuff about when you\\'re in the moment. Yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS When you\\'ve had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble. How would you like that to be different? EOS I don\\'t know. Just more or less like if Donna was there and maybe if my mates got some girlfriends or something like that would calm them down too.

EOS Mm-hmm. EOS So just hang out instead of go and do stuff, like stupid stuff. EOS Okay. So-so Donna\\'s helped calm you down and you\\'d like, um, them to calm down too? EOS Yeah, \\'cause then we could hang out together and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -with our girlfriends and stuff. EOS So am I hearing that it\\'s tricky in some ways to hang out with them sometimes- EOS Yeah. EOS -now that you\\'re with Donna? EOS Yeah. Cause I like I feel guilty not spending my time with, yeah, Donna. Like, I miss my mates, like, I get lonely and stuff, but even though they get me into trouble, but- EOS Hmm. EOS -just, kind of, feel stoked that-that I see them on the weekends and stuff. EOS Okay. So-so what\\'s the definition, for you, of a good mate? EOS It\\'s, like, loyal- EOS Mm-hmm. EOS -yes, someone who\\'s got my back. EOS So, someone who\\'s loyal, someone who\\'s got your back, yeah? What else? What else is really your definition of a really good mate? EOS That\\'s about it. It\\'s-- yeah. EOS Hmm. EOS Someone who\\'ll stand up for you. EOS Oh, so, someone who\\'ll stand up for you? EOS Yeah.',\n",

EOS You\\'ve done-- You\\'ve got a really good track record of, uh, being on time. Yeah? Do you realize that? EOS Yeah, no, it\\'s easy. EOS Yeah. Yeah. You know, I\\'ve been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you\\'ve made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we\\'ve been meeting? EOS Uh. Meeting\\'s definitely helped. EOS Yeah? EOS Yeah. It\\'s helped- EOS Yeah? EOS -heaps. EOS It\\'s helped heaps? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with? EOS Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy? EOS Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that\\'s a pretty big deal. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I\\'m wondering if the Billy of six months ago would\\'ve done that? EOS Nah. I didn\\'t really think about it frankly. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What\\'s shifted in you? EOS I don\\'t know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it\\'ll make things easier. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time. EOS Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that\\'s just really helpful. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS  if I\\'d got into polytech and stuff, so I think that\\'s good. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS So, where are the forms now? EOS They\\'re still at home. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. If— EOS So, what needs to happen next? EOS Just take them in. EOS So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you? EOS Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I\\'ll just drop them in. EOS Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you\\'re gonna do that? EOS Uh, probably by the end of this week. EOS Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech? EOS Yeah. EOS And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there? EOS I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don\\'t even know any course that I\\'ll do. EOS Mm-hmm. So what\\'s the- what\\'s the-- Say, if you get on the course- EOS Yeah. EOS -and, um, you\\'re, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don\\'t feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that? EOS Well, um-- Well, I don\\'t know. Hopefully, there\\'s not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don\\'t know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something. EOS Mm. Yeah? EOS Yeah. EOS So, all these changes that you\\'ve- that you\\'ve made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now? EOS Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way. EOS So, offending gets in the way of the life that you\\'re starting to lead? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending? EOS Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy. EOS Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend. EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve noticed that when you\\'ve been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or? EOS Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It\\'s kind of harder to think straight. EOS It\\'s harder to think straight when you\\'ve been drinking? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Yeah. And so you\\'ve got Donna around at the moment? EOS Yeah. EOS And that\\'s helping keep you in check, as you said? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. What would happen if she wasn\\'t around say or at a party or? EOS I\\'d probably just go be stupid with my mates. EOS Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength? EOS Yeah. \\'Cause if there\\'s just like if a mate said they\\'re gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don\\'t know. She say that\\'s stupid and stuff. And I don\\'t know. It gives me something to do. EOS Mm. What do you think? EOS Just kind of stupid. Well, it\\'s pointless, but still a bit of a laugh. EOS Mm. Yeah. \\'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you\\'ve got about the job and a life with Donna and- EOS Mm. EOS -kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn\\'t fit in with that dream or that idea. EOS No. EOS So there\\'s that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there\\'s the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you\\'ve had a few to drink and you\\'re with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh? EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah? EOS Mm. EOS And it sounds like sometimes when you\\'re in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it\\'s hard to hold on to that vision of the future. EOS Yeah. You don\\'t really think about that. Well, just in the moment. EOS Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking? EOS Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking. EOS Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next- EOS Mm. EOS -kind of minute or so- EOS No. Just, like, it\\'s not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah. EOS So it\\'s not your idea. And you also go along with it? EOS Yeah. You can\\'t really be like, \"Oh no,\" just give me shit. EOS Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no? EOS Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don\\'t know. And they\\'d talk me into it probably. EOS Mm-hmm. So it\\'s hard to actually say no to your friends- EOS Yeah. EOS -\\'cause of what they- what they thought of you. EOS They\\'d just think I was joking, yeah. EOS Yeah. So I\\'m wondering what the-the thinking, \\'cause, um, one of the things that\\'s really changed for you is being with Donna. EOS Yeah. EOS So I\\'m wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys. EOS I don\\'t see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so- EOS Mm-hmm. EOS I don\\'t think, like, I am not sure they like it. EOS Then so when you\\'re-- so you\\'re spending less time with them and more time with Donna? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And you\\'re saying you\\'re kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you\\'re spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past? EOS They don\\'t lead me into trouble. But- EOS Okay. So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it. EOS Uh, like it\\'s my choice though, they don\\'t make me. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. I know it\\'s just having grown up with, it\\'s just what we\\'ve always done. EOS Okay. So that\\'s just what you\\'ve always done. EOS Yeah. EOS But we\\'re also talking about this idea that it doesn\\'t fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are? EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be? EOS My life? Well, what do you mean? EOS Mm, well the stuff about when you\\'re in the moment. Yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS When you\\'ve had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble.

And that means you\\'re spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past? EOS They don\\'t lead me into trouble. But- EOS Okay. So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it. EOS Uh, like it\\'s my choice though, they don\\'t make me. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. I know it\\'s just having grown up with, it\\'s just what we\\'ve always done. EOS Okay. So that\\'s just what you\\'ve always done. EOS Yeah. EOS But we\\'re also talking about this idea that it doesn\\'t fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are? EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be? EOS My life? Well, what do you mean? EOS Mm, well the stuff about when you\\'re in the moment. Yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS When you\\'ve had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble. How would you like that to be different? EOS I don\\'t know. Just more or less like if Donna was there and maybe if my mates got some girlfriends or something like that would calm them down too. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS So just hang out instead of go and do stuff, like stupid stuff. EOS Okay. So-so Donna\\'s helped calm you down and you\\'d like, um, them to calm down too? EOS Yeah, \\'cause then we could hang out together and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -with our girlfriends and stuff. EOS So am I hearing that it\\'s tricky in some ways to hang out with them sometimes- EOS Yeah. EOS -now that you\\'re with Donna? EOS Yeah. Cause I like I feel guilty not spending my time with, yeah, Donna. Like, I miss my mates, like, I get lonely and stuff, but even though they get me into trouble, but- EOS Hmm. EOS -just, kind of, feel stoked that-that I see them on the weekends and stuff. EOS Okay. So-so what\\'s the definition, for you, of a good mate? EOS It\\'s, like, loyal- EOS Mm-hmm. EOS -yes, someone who\\'s got my back. EOS So, someone who\\'s loyal, someone who\\'s got your back, yeah? What else? What else is really your definition of a really good mate? EOS That\\'s about it. It\\'s-- yeah. EOS Hmm. EOS Someone who\\'ll stand up for you. EOS Oh, so, someone who\\'ll stand up for you? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? Yeah. Sounds like a really strong definition of a good mate- EOS Yeah. EOS -for you? So, I\\'m wondering about, um, whether good mates lead you into trouble, if it\\'s something you wanna do. If you got something different that you wanna do, what would a good mate do in that situation? EOS I mean, support me. EOS Yeah. How-how would you wanna be supported, Billy? EOS Just don\\'t give me shit about, I don\\'t know. Um, yeah, just, if I- if I don\\'t wanna go do something, don\\'t, like, don\\'t give me shit about it.',\n",

       " {'Context': 'Hi, Billy. EOS Hi. EOS Hi, another session and another session where you are actually on time. EOS Yeah. EOS You\\'ve done-- You\\'ve got a really good track record of, uh, being on time. Yeah? Do you realize that? EOS Yeah, no, it\\'s easy. EOS Yeah. Yeah. You know, I\\'ve been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you\\'ve made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we\\'ve been meeting? EOS Uh. Meeting\\'s definitely helped. EOS Yeah? EOS Yeah. It\\'s helped- EOS Yeah? EOS -heaps. EOS It\\'s helped heaps? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with? EOS Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy? EOS Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff- EOS Mm. EOS -and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that\\'s a pretty big deal. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I\\'m wondering if the Billy of six months ago would\\'ve done that? EOS Nah. I didn\\'t really think about it frankly. EOS Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What\\'s shifted in you? EOS I don\\'t know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it\\'ll make things easier. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time. EOS Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that\\'s just really helpful. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS  if I\\'d got into polytech and stuff, so I think that\\'s good. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS So, where are the forms now? EOS They\\'re still at home. EOS Mm-hmm. EOS Yeah. If— EOS So, what needs to happen next? EOS Just take them in. EOS So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you? EOS Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I\\'ll just drop them in. EOS Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you\\'re gonna do that? EOS Uh, probably by the end of this week. EOS Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech? EOS Yeah. EOS And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there? EOS I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don\\'t even know any course that I\\'ll do. EOS Mm-hmm. So what\\'s the- what\\'s the-- Say, if you get on the course- EOS Yeah. EOS -and, um, you\\'re, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don\\'t feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that? EOS Well, um-- Well, I don\\'t know. Hopefully, there\\'s not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don\\'t know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something. EOS Mm. Yeah? EOS Yeah. EOS So, all these changes that you\\'ve- that you\\'ve made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now? EOS Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way. EOS So, offending gets in the way of the life that you\\'re starting to lead? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending? EOS Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy. EOS Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend. EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve noticed that when you\\'ve been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or? EOS Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It\\'s kind of harder to think straight. EOS It\\'s harder to think straight when you\\'ve been drinking? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. Yeah. And so you\\'ve got Donna around at the moment? EOS Yeah. EOS And that\\'s helping keep you in check, as you said? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. What would happen if she wasn\\'t around say or at a party or? EOS I\\'d probably just go be stupid with my mates. EOS Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength? EOS Yeah. \\'Cause if there\\'s just like if a mate said they\\'re gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don\\'t know. She say that\\'s stupid and stuff. And I don\\'t know. It gives me something to do. EOS Mm. What do you think? EOS Just kind of stupid. Well, it\\'s pointless, but still a bit of a laugh. EOS Mm. Yeah. \\'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you\\'ve got about the job and a life with Donna and- EOS Mm. EOS -kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn\\'t fit in with that dream or that idea. EOS No. EOS So there\\'s that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there\\'s the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you\\'ve had a few to drink and you\\'re with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh? EOS Yeah. EOS So you\\'ve got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah? EOS Mm. EOS And it sounds like sometimes when you\\'re in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it\\'s hard to hold on to that vision of the future. EOS Yeah. You don\\'t really think about that. Well, just in the moment. EOS Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking? EOS Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking. EOS Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next- EOS Mm. EOS -kind of minute or so- EOS No. Just, like, it\\'s not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah. EOS So it\\'s not your idea. And you also go along with it? EOS Yeah. You can\\'t really be like, \"Oh no,\" just give me shit. EOS Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no? EOS Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don\\'t know. And they\\'d talk me into it probably. EOS Mm-hmm. So it\\'s hard to actually say no to your friends- EOS Yeah. EOS -\\'cause of what they- what they thought of you. EOS They\\'d just think I was joking, yeah. EOS Yeah. So I\\'m wondering what the-the thinking, \\'cause, um, one of the things that\\'s really changed for you is being with Donna. EOS Yeah. EOS So I\\'m wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys. EOS I don\\'t see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so- EOS Mm-hmm. EOS I don\\'t think, like, I am not sure they like it. EOS Then so when you\\'re-- so you\\'re spending less time with them and more time with Donna? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. And you\\'re saying you\\'re kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you\\'re spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past? EOS They don\\'t lead me into trouble. But- EOS Okay.

It's like I can drink probably like seven or eight drinks like if I'm going hard. Um, and then, you know, like maybe when I get home from school, a long day at the library, have a beer or two, so.
